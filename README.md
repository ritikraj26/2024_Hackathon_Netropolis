## Background

Japan's aging population, declining birthrate, and shrinking rural workforce threaten the preservation of local economies, culture, and heritage. This project addresses these challenges.  

## Issues and Solution

* **Local Issues:** Labor shortages impact farms, forests, and cultural preservation. Communities seek individuals who resonate with their values.
* **User Issues:** People want to support rural areas but need trial experiences before relocating. 
* **Solution:** A platform matching short-term, meaningful work with immersive rural experiences, connecting users to communities with shared values.

## Hackathon Goals

Develop core platform functions to foster revitalization and user engagement through a "quest" system combining work, culture, and leisure.

* **Specific Functionality:**
    * Secure login (user and community manager)
    * Intuitive location-based quest registration
    * User-friendly quest scheduling tools
    * LLM-powered search for optimized results
    * Streamlined quest request process

## Installation

**Frontend** 
* `npm install`

## Usage
